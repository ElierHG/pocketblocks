# PocketBlocks overview

## What is PocketBlocks?

**Openblocks + PocketBase = PocketBlocks.**

PocketBlocks is a integration between Openblocks and PocketBase.

Traditionally, building an internal app requires complex frontend and backend interactions with hundreds and thousands lines of code, not to mention work on packaging, integration and deployment. PocketBlocks significantly reduces the work you need to do to build an app.

In PocketBlocks, all you need to do is drag and drop pre-built or self-customized components onto the What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) canvas, PocketBlocks helps you build an app quickly and focus on business logic.

## Why choose PocketBlocks?

- **Open source**: Makes your ideas more feasible.
- **High scalability**: Allows to execute JavaScript almost anywhere you would like to customize your business processes and UI components.
- **Clean design**: Follows the principles of Ant Design and supports display on screens of different sizes. We have a number of UI components, based on which you can freely build dashboard, admin panel, and content management system (CMS).

## How to build an app in PocketBlocks?

Building an internal app basically takes 4 steps:

1. Quickly connect to your Pocketbase API using its SDK.
2. Use pre-built or user-customized UI components to build your app UI.
3. Set up [event handlers](build-apps/event-handlers.md) to trigger javascript functions, control components or other actions in reaction to user interactions.
4. Preview and share your app with others.
