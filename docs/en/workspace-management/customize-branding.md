# Custom branding

PocketBlocks provides a white-labeling feature that allows you to customize your workspace's **branding**, including logo, favicon, brand name and color. You can easily configure branding to match your company's branding and benefit from consistent experiences with your company's existing internal tools.

## Branding settings

Only **Admins** have permission to customize branding. Navigate to **PocketBlocks Settings** and go to **Branding**.

As you change the data, the preview on the side updates in real time.

{% hint style="info" %}
This customization only applies to non-administrators, so administrators continue to view the default branding(PocketBlocks).
